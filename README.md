## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip for Python package installation

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required Python packages:

  ```sh
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
4. Run the project:

  ```sh
  uvicorn main:app --reload
  ```

### Docker Installation

You can also run this project using Docker. Pull the Docker image from GitHub Container Registry:

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/lowkey88/meta-glasses-gemini:master
```

Run the Docker container:

```sh
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env ghcr.io/lowkey88/meta-glasses-gemini:master
```

You can also use Docker Compose to manage the services. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the project directory with the following content:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  app:
    container_name: raybanmeta
    image: ghcr.io/lowkey88/meta-glasses-gemini:master
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    env_file:
      - .env
    depends_on:
      - cache
    volumes:
      - ./creds:/app/creds

  cache:
    container_name: redismeta
    image: redis:7.2.5
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"
    environment:
      - REDIS_PASSWORD=${REDIS_DB_PASSWORD}
    volumes:
      - ./db:/data/
```

To start the services, run:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

### Environment Variables

You need to set the following environment variables in a `.env` file within the project directory:

```dotenv
WHATSAPP_AUTH_TOKEN=
WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER=
WHATSAPP_PHONE_ID=
WHATSAPP_WEBHOOK_VERIFICATION_TOKEN=
REDIS_DB_HOST=
REDIS_DB_PORT=
REDIS_DB_PASSWORD=
GEMINI_API_KEY=
CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME=
NOTION_INTEGRATION_SECRET=
NOTION_DATABASE_ID=
NOTION_FOOD_DATABASE_ID=
SERPER_DEV_API_KEY=
CRAWLBASE_API_KEY=
OAUTH_CREDENTIALS_ENCODED=
HOME_ASSISTANT_TOKEN=
HOME_ASSISTANT_URL=
HOME_ASSISTANT_AGENT_ID=
```

- `WHATSAPP_AUTH_TOKEN`: Create an app at [Meta for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/) and retrieve the WhatsApp authentication token.
- `WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER`: The senderâ€™s phone number associated with your WhatsApp API. This is the number from which the bot sends messages to your WhatsApp account.
- `WHATSAPP_PHONE_ID`: The unique identifier associated with your WhatsApp Business phone number.
- `WHATSAPP_WEBHOOK_VERIFICATION_TOKEN`: Set a verification token of your choice and use it in the Meta for Developers dashboard to verify the webhook.
- `REDIS_DB_HOST`, `REDIS_DB_PORT`, `REDIS_DB_PASSWORD`: Credentials for your Redis database. This project uses Redis for managing data, including storing images for analysis.
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Obtain this from the Google Gemini API for image analysis and AI capabilities.
- `CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME`: The name of your Google Cloud Storage bucket for storing images and data.
- `NOTION_INTEGRATION_SECRET`, `NOTION_DATABASE_ID`, `NOTION_FOOD_DATABASE_ID`: Create a Notion integration and databases with fields (Title, Category, Content, Created At, Completed). Share the databases with the integration.
- `SERPER_DEV_API_KEY`, `CRAWLBASE_API_KEY`: Obtain these API keys from the respective websites to enable advanced search and data retrieval functionalities.
- `OAUTH_CREDENTIALS_ENCODED`: Base64 encode your Google OAuth credentials and set them here.
- `HOME_ASSISTANT_TOKEN`: The token for authenticating with your Home Assistant instance.
- `HOME_ASSISTANT_URL`: The URL of your Home Assistant instance.
- `HOME_ASSISTANT_AGENT_ID`: The ID of the agent in Home Assistant that will handle the integration.

### Additional Configuration

- **Google Cloud Platform Credentials**: Place your `google-credentials.json` file in the project root. This file should contain credentials for your GCP project.
- **Google OAuth Token**: Ensure you have a `credentials.json` file for OAuth to enable Google Calendar integrations. Follow the Google Calendar API documentation to obtain this token.
- **Create a Meta App**: Create an app at [Meta for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/) to obtain the WhatsApp API credentials, and set up the webhook to your URL.

### Home Assistant Integration

**Configuration**

Add to `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
rest_command:
  whatsapp_notify:
  url: "https://your-api/send-notification"

  content_type: "application/json"
  payload: >-
    {"message": "{{ message }}"
    {%- if image_url is defined -%}
    , "image_url": "{{ image_url }}"
    {%- endif -%}}
```

**Example Automations**

1. Text Notification

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Door Alert"
  trigger:
    - platform: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.front_door
    to: "on"

      message: "Front door opened"
```

2. Camera Notification

```yaml
