## [1.1.8] - 2025-06-08

### Critical Bug Fix: Limitless Speaker Identification System

#### Major Issue Resolution
- **Problem**: Dashboard displaying "Unknown" speakers and generic "Speaker" labels instead of proper "Speaker 0", "Speaker 1", "Speaker 2" naming convention
- **Impact**: Poor user experience with confusing speaker identification across all Limitless recordings
- **Root Cause**: Multiple code paths in the system creating inconsistent speaker names from Limitless API responses

#### Comprehensive Speaker Standardization System
- **Enhanced API Processing**:
  * Upgraded `extract_speakers_from_contents()` to handle Limitless API returning "Unknown" as actual speaker names
  * Implemented dynamic "Speaker N" mapping with sequential numbering (Speaker 0, Speaker 1, Speaker 2, etc.)
  * Added proper speaker ID to Speaker N name mapping for consistent transcript building

- **Cache Data Standardization**:
  * Created `standardize_cached_speakers()` function to fix existing cached recordings
  * Applied standardization to all cache loading endpoints in dashboard
  * Ensured backward compatibility with existing data structures

- **Bulletproof Validation Pipeline**:
  * Added `validate_speaker_names()` as final validation before caching
  * Fixed transcript building logic to assign proper Speaker N numbers for unmapped speakers
  * Eliminated generic "Speaker" labels without numbers

#### Historical Data Fixes
- **Targeted Fix Scripts** (preserved in `scripts/fixes/`):
  * `fix_limitless_speakers.py` - Initial fix for Unknown speakers
  * `fix_false_speakers.py` - Fixed 86 recordings with `is_speaker=False` Unknown speakers
  * `fix_speaker_naming_bug.py` - Fixed 1 recording with generic "Speaker" label
  * Multiple debug and diagnostic scripts for troubleshooting

#### Script Organization & Documentation
- **Professional Script Management**:
  * Moved all temporary fix scripts to organized `scripts/fixes/` directory
  * Created comprehensive `scripts/README.md` with categorized documentation
  * Moved `cleanup_fix_scripts.py` and `LIMITLESS_SPEAKER_FIX_SUMMARY.md` to scripts folder
  * Preserved historical context and usage guidelines for future reference

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Core Speaker Processing Enhancements
```python
# Enhanced speaker extraction with Unknown detection
def extract_speakers_from_contents(log: Dict) -> List[Dict[str, str]]:
    # Converts problematic speaker names to proper Speaker N format
    if valid_names:
        speaker_name = sorted(valid_names)[0]
    else:
        # All names are problematic - assign Speaker N
        speaker_n_name = f"Speaker {unrecognized_speaker_counter}"
        speaker_id_mapping[speaker_id] = speaker_n_name
```

#### Cache Standardization System
```python
def standardize_cached_speakers(extracted_data: Dict) -> Dict:
    # Fix any "Unknown" speakers with comprehensive detection
    if (person_name.lower() in ['unknown', 'unknown speaker'] and 
        person.get('is_speaker')):
        new_speaker_name = f"Speaker {unknown_speaker_counter}"
        person['name'] = new_speaker_name
```

#### Final Validation Pipeline
```python
def validate_speaker_names(extracted_data: Dict, log_id: str) -> Dict:
    # Last line of defense against any remaining Unknown speakers
    if person_name.lower() in ['unknown', 'unknown speaker']:
        person['name'] = f'Speaker {next_speaker_number}'
        logger.error(f"CRITICAL: Found Unknown speaker in final validation")
```

- **Documentation Requirements**: Comprehensive README files for complex fixes
- **Validation Pipeline**: Multiple layers of speaker name validation

## [1.1.7] - 2025-06-08

### Major Fixes & Improvements

#### Limitless Task Counting Issue Resolution
- **Critical Bug Fix**:
  * Resolved severe under-counting issue where dashboard showed 4 tasks but Google Tasks showed 11+

  * Added "All synced â€¢ X tasks" green status indicator when everything is up to date
  * Quick stats summary showing recordings/tasks/memories count (hidden on mobile)
  * Consistent pill design for all status indicators
  * Enhanced visual hierarchy and spacing

- **Smart State Management**:
  * Shows relevant information based on sync status
  * No more awkward empty space - always displays useful information
  * Responsive design for mobile optimization

#### Logging System Optimization
- **Reduced Sync Noise**:
  * Changed "already processed, skipping" messages from INFO to DEBUG level
  * Added summary logging: "X processed, Y skipped from Z total recordings"
  * Moved debug information to appropriate log levels
  * Eliminated log spam during scheduled background syncs (every 5 minutes)

- **Enhanced Logging Configuration**:
  * Created custom logging system with batch processing
  * Centralized configuration for Limitless logging levels

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Task Counting Logic Fixes
```python
# CRITICAL FIX: Preserve natural language tasks from previous cache
for task in extracted.get('tasks', []):
    if isinstance(task, dict) and task.get('source') == 'natural_language':
        if not any(t.get('description') == task.get('description') for t in validated_tasks):
            validated_tasks.append(task)
```

#### Emergency Backward Compatibility
```python
# Handle both new format (with created_successfully) and legacy format
if task.get('created_successfully') is True:
    validated_count += 1
elif 'created_successfully' not in task:
    # Legacy format: assume successful if has description
    if task.get('description') and len(str(task.get('description')).strip()) > 0:
        legacy_count += 1
```

### Files Modified
- `functionality/limitless.py`: Enhanced task validation and preservation logic
- `api/dashboard/limitless_routes.py`: Fixed double counting and added backward compatibility
- `dashboard/app/dashboard/limitless/page.tsx`: Improved sync status bar design
- `utils/limitless_logger.py`: Created custom logging system (NEW)
- `utils/limitless_config.py`: Centralized Limitless configuration (NEW)

### Results
- **Task Count Accuracy**: Fixed from 4 to 23 tasks (correctly matching Google Tasks)
- **UI Polish**: Professional, space-efficient sync status bar
- **Log Cleanliness**: Eliminated sync noise while preserving important information
- **Maintenance Tools**: Force reprocess command available for future debugging
